## My journey with stone

I began my journey into building in 2012 as an apprentice stonemason restoring the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, ON.  Working on a building, which was originally completed in 1865, gave me insight into the incredible craftsmanship and strength masonry achieves. Moving to Victoria, BC, I was a part of the Empress Hotel restoration. Around the same time I got a part time job with a friend who restored chimneys and got to know the skyline of Victoria. 


I eventually found a stonemason who would take me on as an apprentice building stone patios, pathways, walls and fireplaces. I will always be grateful for having that opportunity to learn and see what a career in stone can look like. Now I do residential stonework. I enjoy connecting with my clients and sharing my passion for stone.


Stone has a proud past with deep history, with present day applications that will last far into the future.
