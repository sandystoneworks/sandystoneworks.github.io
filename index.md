## Me

I began my journey into building in 2012 as an apprentice stonemason restoring the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, ON.  Working on a building, which was originally completed in 1865, gave me insight into the incredible craftsmanship and strength masonry achieves.  I completed my Ontario College of Masonry Level One and shortly after moved to Victoria, BC where I began working on the Empress Hotel - another restoration project, this time brick masonry.  But my interests soon expanded as I explored the huge forests of the Pacific Northwest.  I attended James Mitchellâ€™s Island School of Building Arts in 2017 on Gabriola Island.  It was a 3 month course in Timber Framing and Log Building and the passion I felt about working with materials from the earth deepened.  Over the next few years I worked residentially, completing stone paths, walls, pillars, and patios.  I took a few night school courses at Camosun College for Cabinetry and delved head on into my own projects with wood and stone.
